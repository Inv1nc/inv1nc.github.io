Hello Friend,  

I solved few challenges in the NahamCon CTF 2024 which went down from May 24-26. I managed to 10+ challenges.

Hope you find it interesting!

## Warmup

### Read The Rules

```
curl -s https://ctf.nahamcon.com/rules | grep -o ctf{.*}
```

**Flag:** flag{90bc54705794a62015369fd8e86e557b}  

### That's Not My Base

Everyone knows about Base64, but do you know about this one?  

(Remember, the flag format starts with flag{!)  

`F#S<YRXdP0Fd=,%J4c$Ph7XV(gF/*]%C4B<qlH+%3xGHo)\`

We are given with a base92 encoded code. By using cyberchef we can get the flag.

**Flag:** flag{784454a9509196a33dba242c423c057a}  

### EICAR

What is the MD5 hash of this file?  

Wrap the hexadecimal value in the `flag{` prefix and `{` suffix to match the standard flag format.  

```
md5_hash=$(md5sum eicar | awk '{print $1}')
echo 'flag{'$md5_hash'}'
```

**Flag**: flag{44d88612fea8a8f36de82e1278abb02f}  

### Twine

Google tells me that twine means: "strong thread or string consisting of two or more strands of hemp, cotton, or nylon twisted together."  

```
strings twine.jpg  | grep -o flag{.*}
```

**Flag:** flag{4ac54e3ba5f8f09049f3ad62403abb25}

### Copypasta

You know those funny Internet messages that everybody likes to copy and paste? Yeah....  

Turns out they make a good Warmups CTF challenge, too!  

copy - CTRL + SHIFT + c  
paste - CTRL + SHIFT + v

**Flag:** flag{1f68e019b29650f6e8ea15a7808f76fd}

### Uriel

Uriel was browsing the web and he saw this big long blob of text in his address bar! He was telling me about it but I don't remember everything he said... I think he mentioned something like "it happened twice?"  


`%25%36%36%25%36%63%25%36%31%25%36%37%25%37%62%25%33%38%25%36%35%25%36%36%25%36%35%25%36%32%25%33%36%25%33%36%25%36%31%25%33%37%25%33%31%25%33%39%25%36%32%25%33%37%25%33%35%25%36%31%25%33%34%25%36%32%25%33%37%25%36%33%25%33%36%25%33%33%25%33%34%25%36%34%25%33%38%25%33%38%25%33%35%25%33%37%25%33%38%25%33%38%25%36%34%25%36%36%25%36%33%25%37%64`


```
from urllib.parse import unquote

uriel = "%25%36%36%25%36%63%25%36%31%25%36%37%25%37%62%25%33%38%25%36%35%25%36%36%25%36%35%25%36%32%25%33%36%25%33%36%25%36%31%25%33%37%25%33%31%25%33%39%25%36%32%25%33%37%25%33%35%25%36%31%25%33%34%25%36%32%25%33%37%25%36%33%25%33%36%25%33%33%25%33%34%25%36%34%25%33%38%25%33%38%25%33%35%25%33%37%25%33%38%25%33%38%25%36%34%25%36%36%25%36%33%25%37%64"

# double url decoding
flag = unquote(unquote(uriel))

print(flag)
```

**Flag:** flag{8efeb66a719b75a4b7c634d885788dfc}

### Technical Support 

Want to join the party of GIFs, memes and emoji shenanigans? Or just want to ask a question for technical support regarding any challenges in the CTF?  

This CTF uses support tickets to help handle requests. If you need assistance, please create a ticket with the #ctf-open-ticket channel. You do not need to direct message any CTF organizers or facilitators, they will just tell you to open a ticket. You might find a flag in the ticket channel, though!  

**Flag:**  flag{a98373a74abb8c5ebb8f5192e034a91c}

## Web

### All About Robots

Oh wow! Now you can learn all about robots, with our latest web service, All About Robots!!  

```
curl -s http://challenge.nahamcon.com:30998/robots.txt
echo
curl -s http://challenge.nahamcon.com:30998/open_the_pod_bay_doors_hal_and_give_me_the_flag.html | grep -o flag{.*}
```

**Flag:** flag{3f19b983c1de42bd49af1a237d7e57b9}

### iDoor

It's Apple's latest innovation, the "iDoor!" ... well, it is basically the Ring Doorbell camera, but the iDoor offers a web-based browser to monitor your camera, and super secure using ultimate cryptography with even SHA256 hashing algorithms to protect customers! Don't even think about snooping on other people's cameras!!  


Code to generate wordlist to exploit IDOR Vulnerability

``` python
from hashlib import sha256

for i in range(101):
    print(sha256(str(i).encode()).hexdigest())
```

using the wordlist, i bruteforced the user endpoint and got the flag.  

**Flag:** flag{770a058a80a9bca0a87c3e2ebe1ee9b2}

## Misc

### Not Quite the Same

Everyone knows MD5 hashes. Everyone knows .png files! I believe you'll collide with greatness.  

By uploading two different `.png` files with same md5 hashes from [this github repository](https://github.com/corkami/collisions) get the flag.  



**Flag:** flag{0800fc577294c34e0b28ad2839435945}

---

## Scripting

### Base3200

Extracted given `theflag.xz` a xz archive file.  

```
xz -d theflag.xz
```

```python
from base64 import b64decode

f = open('theflag', 'r')
flag = f.read()

for _ in range(50):
	flag = b64decode(flag)
print(flag.decode())
```

**Flag:** flag{340ff1bee05244546c91dea53fba7642}
